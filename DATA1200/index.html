        "EPS is a mixture of “Project Related Courses” and project organized/problem based learning. It is 
        crafted to address the design requirements of the degree and prepare engineering students with all 
        the necessary skills to face the challenges of today’s world economy. Students work in international 
        and interdisciplinary teams of 3–6 students on their projects. Projects are done in cooperation with 
        commercial businesses and industries or with research centers. There are minor differences between 
        EPS-projects and the various EPS-providers, but all providers have agreed about the following key elements.</p>
